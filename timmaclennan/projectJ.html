				  <p><strong>House On Main</strong> was created to help out a clothing store in Royal Oak, MI. The owner of the store, Judy, owned the business for over 10 years, but never invested in advertising. Our challenge was to come up with an advertising strategy for House On Main that would help the store achieve more brand recognition, and also generate more sales.</p>
				  <p> <strong>The Challenge:</strong> House On Main owner Judy had never invested in advertising for her business. This made it very difficult to come up with a plan to suit her needs, because we had nothing to benchmark against to see what worked for her in the past. In addition, Judy's business was atypical; she had a very unique clothing store compared to everyone around her, and her business was open at very select times. Another challenge was communicating the value of Judy's personal fashion services to her clients, which many of them did not know about.</p>
				  <p> <strong>The Solution:</strong> After doing a lot of research on House On Main, we determined that the best method for advertising was to focus on local organic growth, spread through word of mouth from her current customers. One component that helped this idea was the addition of a referral program for Judy's customers, to give them an incentive to promote the business on Judy's behalf. In addition to the referral program, we also came up with the idea for Judy to host a fashion show twice a year to show off all of the unique styles that can only be found in her store. Lastly, we created a website for Judy that showed off some of the products that she sold. After presenting our solutions to Judy, our group won our capstone class advertising competition, and several of our ideas have been implemented into House On Main.</p>
