				  <p><strong>WingMan</strong> is a prototype application that was created using Adobe Illustrator. WingMan was designed to help people who have a hard time getting out of their houses, to go out and meet people. The application has several sections that comprise it, such as: Advice, Places, Fashion, and Challenges. </p>
				  <p><strong>Advice: </strong>The Advice section is all about giving good tips for people so they know how to conduct themselves when trying to meet others. </p>
				  <p><strong>Fashion: </strong>The Fashion section focuses on providing unique advice and looks for people who want to dress confidently. Users can also submit their own images and have them be critiqued by others.</p>
				  <p><strong>Places: </strong>The places section shows all of the local hot-spots, along with basic information and ratings so you know where to go. </p>
				  <p><strong>Challenges: </strong>This section gives users objectives that they can choose to ignore or complete on their own.</p>
				  <p><strong>Note* Colors shown are not final, and are only used to separate sections for easier presentation. </strong></p>
