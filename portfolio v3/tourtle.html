        <h2 class="project-page"> Why Tourtle </h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          Traditional museums tend to focus on looking and reading; you walk up to and exhibit, look at it, read the information plaque, and do that 100 more times throughout the visit.
          The problem is, kids aren't engaged with the museum material because it's not presented to them in a form they enjoy. Tourtle was created to solve this problem, by helping present all of the same information
          in a form kids can digest and have fun with.

        <h2 class="project-page">Research Process</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
            Before Tourtle what is created, we needed to examine the traditional museum experience and see if we could find opportunities to improve it.
            To do this, we employed several research methodologies to help gain a complete picture of the traditional museum experience.

        <h3 class="project-page"> Literature Reviews </h3>
        <p class="project-text">
            Museums have been around for thousands of years, and there's a lot of great knowledge which we could take advantage of which helps describe the museum experience while also pointing out potential issues.
            To take advantage of all this information, we conducted literature reviews to specifically look at how the museum experience works for children. Through conducting a literature review, we were able to
            find great background information, which can be seen through several of these quotes:
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          “What children take away from their experiences is determined by a combination of what they do and what they talk about.”
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "The combination of hands‐on engagement with objects and elaborative talk during events may promote successful transfer"
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          "Overall, conversation and building tips helped parents to initiate conversations with children during an interactive activity."
        </p>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <h3 class="project-page"> Observations </h3>
        <p class="project-text">
            In addition to literature reviews we felt it was crucial to gain first-hand real-world experience with the potential issues kids have with the museum experience;
            to do this we decided to visit two different museums in the Detroit area and act as silent observers to be as unobtrusive as possible.

            While visiting each museum, we observed kids are not engaging with traditional museum exhibits; they were much more interested in exhibits which allowed them to interact via touching, audio, or creating. Additionally, we also learned parents are trying to engage with their kids while and help them learn about the exhibits.

            Finally, we created and deployed a 26 question survey which was aimed at learning more about people's museum experience. In particular, we wanted to focus on how going to the museum with a child affected their experience, and what their point of view was regarding how to improve the experience for kids.

          After creating our prototype, we wanted to test it out with users and other UX professionals to get their opinion on it. As was expected, our prototype had a few major concerns that needed to be addressed:
        </p>
        <ul class="styled-list">
          <li class="quote">The bear as a whole was too large, children couldn't carry it around easily</li>
          <li class="quote">Because of the internals, the bear became too heavy to carry around and fatigued children easily</li>
          <li class="quote">There was concern about the bear being left behind as kids run throughout the museum</li>

        <h3 class="project-page"> Prototyping - Final Interation</h3>
        <p class="project-text">
          After receieving feedback on our first prototype, we made many changes. We switched our stuffed animal to a much smaller slap-bracelet, which meant less weight and bulk to carry around. Using a slap bracelet also means the toy will always be attached to the kid, making it less of a burden on them. Secondly, we changed the technical implementation; we swapped out the LittleBits system in favor of an Arduino because of the added control and flexibility to the project.

          Our second prototype ended up having a few issues with its implementation, the biggest being we couldn't actually integrate the Arduino system into the prototype. After working on it for several weeks, we were unable to find a way to shrink the prototype down to a small enough size to fit into the turtles shell, so we ended up leaving them as separate components in the end.

        <p class="project-text">
          This project was unique because it revolved around the concept of improving the museum experience, which is not something I had much experience with before starting the project. However, that made the project
          more interesting, as I had the opportunity to learn about an entirely new field with its own set of rules and restrictions.
        </p>
       <p class="project-text">
         The toughest part of this project was narrowing down our solution concepts. There are so many possible ways to improve the museum experience for kids, and it took a long time
         for us to decide how exactly what approach we wanted to take. However, after going through the entire process, I think we did a good job exploring many different avenues to tackle this issue.
