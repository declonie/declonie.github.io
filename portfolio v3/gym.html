        <p class="project-text">
          Our motivation for creating LG is a combination of several different factors. Prior to deciding to go with Life as a Gym glasses as our concept, we conducted background research in various topics; one of the statistics we found was approximately 40-50% of all college students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity, that is, they do not do enough physical activity in a given day to constitute exercise from a medical perspective. We found this statistic to be shocking, and we knew we could make a difference if we challenged this problem from a user experience point of view.

          To answer 3 of our research questions, we decided to use a survey. We chose this method because the questions we needed to collect data on could be easily represented by simple, close-ended questions. Additionally, the questions we asked required quantitative data to back up the responses to make sure any design decisions based on these had validity. Below are some of the results of the types of questions we asked.

           To answer the remaining 2 research questions we developed, we decided to use a Diary Study. Diary studies are a way to collect consistent data throughout a period of time by sending respondents some type of form to fill out on a daily or sometimes more frequent basis. We chose this type of research because we wanted to see how people's behaviors and motivations change from day-to-day when it comes to exercising. The diary study also helped us learn more about topics which cannot easily be tackled in a survey, due to the open-ended nature of the questions. Below is an example of the form we sent to respondents, and some of the data we received from our diary study.

To create our new project proposals, we took all of the data we gathered from our diary studies and survey, and highlighted some of the key factors that appeared in both. These key factors included time management, endurance and strength training, and the need for guidance during exercise.</p>

        <p class="project-text">After this distillation, we began a second ideation phase where each group member would create new project concepts based on the information we learned; ideas were then shared, selected based on commonalities, and then fleshed out. We narrowed down to the three solutions based on feasibility and how close they aligned to the three key factors.</p>

We went in this direction for 2 reasons, first, time management was by far the most consistent issue found throughout our studies, and our smart exercise glasses addressed this problem best. Second, we wanted to take a different approach to solving this problem; smart gym equipment already exists, and we didn't feel we had a unique angle to make a difference.

           After narrowing down our ideation to our Life as a Gym concept, we needed to conduct additional research to flesh out the concept and discover our users thoughts and feelings regarding the AR/VR experience.
           To learn more about this we decided to conduct user enactments. User enactments have users going through a set of different real-world use case scenarios, and seeing how they understand and respond to the activities they perform. For our user enactments we created 8 scenarious which were each designed to solicit feedback about a particular feature or design decision. The subjects of these scenarios included privacy, public exercise, trip planning, navigation, system input types (audio, touch, gesture), and more.

                To gain a better understanding of our target audience, we developed 5 distinct research questions which needed to be answered. We then chose 2 initial research methodologies to help answers these 5 questions, they were as follows:

          <p class="project-text">
            To create our prototype, we utilized a few technical tools. First, a framework called <strong>A-Frame, the backend of our system</strong>. A-Frame is a web-based VR framework, based on Javascript. It allows running a VR experience right in a browser window. In addition to this, we used an additional library call AR.js to add the AR layer and the ability to access the device camera. To duplicate allow users to experience our prototype, we used a Samsung Gear to create the experience.

        <p class="project-text">
          Additionally, we needed to create a set of mockup screens which we could then add to the AR layer of our prototype. These screens were the product of all of the research we conducted previously in this project, especially our User Enactments, where we had users directly look at our previous designs and provide feedback to us. These are samples of several of the prototype screens we made, additional screenshots can be seen in our <a href="http://google.com">interactive demo.</a>
