        <p class="project-text">
          Our motivation for creating LG is a combination of several different factors. Prior to deciding to go with Life as a Gym glasses as our concept, we conducted background research in various topics; one of the statistics we found was approximately 40-50% of all college students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity, that is, they do not do enough physical activity in a given day to constitute exercise from a medical perspective. This statistic was a driving force throughout our project and stuck with us as one of our key motivations throughout the course. This statistic was found out after we completed the majority of the coursework, but we found it was a good justification that helped validate our design and concept.

        <p class="project-text">
          When we began this project, we had no previous knowledge or background information regarding what types of exercises are popular, or what resources are target audience uses when learning about exercise. Additionally, because we were in the beginning phases of the project we wanted to have quantitative evidence to help inform our future design decisions. With these two conditions, we decided a survey would be the best tool available to gather large quantities of data on our target audience, and the types of questions we needed to asked fit a survey format well. Through the use of our survey, we ended up finding several interesting insights that ended up serving is pillars throughout the rest of the project, they were:

           The goal of the diary study was to gain insight into the day-to-day exercise motivations and barriers that our participants faced. In particular, we were hoping to gain insight into novel barrier situations which could not accuratly be captured using a survey.  We chose to use a diary study because it allowed us to capture data over a series of days; this was advantageous because we didn't have to ask participants to recall a lot of information, they could instead give us direct answers based on their daily experience.

        <p class="project-text">
            Because the idea behind our technology is fairly new and not something most people have experienced, we wanted to gain more information about how they would expect the technology to behave in certain scenarios. To learn more about this, we created 8 scenarious which were each designed to solicit feedback about a particular feature or design decision. We created scenarious which tackled privacy, public exercise, trip planning, navigation, system input types (audio, touch, gesture), and more. These informed our design decisions in a major way, and ended up making re-think entire portions of our original system design due to feedbaack we receieved. For example, we changed the entire privacy system of the glasses based on how uncomfortable users felt while acting through the privacy-related scenario. The following are images showing how we conducted our enactment:

          After receieving feedback on our first prototype, we made many changes. We switched our stuffed animal to a much smaller slap-bracelet, which meant less weight and bulk to carry around. Using a slap bracelet also means the toy will always be attached to the kid, making it less of a burden on them. Secondly, we changed the technical implementation; we swapped out the LittleBits system in favor of an Arduino because of the added control and flexibility to the project.

        <p class="project-text">
          Our second prototype ended up having a few issues with its implementation, the biggest being we couldn't actually integrate the Arduino system into the prototype. After working on it for several weeks, we were unable to find a way to shrink the prototype down to a small enough size to fit into the turtles shell, so we ended up leaving them as separate components in the end.

          This project was unique because it revolved around the concept of improving the museum experience, which is not something I had much experience with before starting the project. However, that made the project
          more interesting, as I had the opportunity to learn about an entirely new field with its own set of rules and restrictions.

         The toughest part of this project was narrowing down our solution concepts. There are so many possible ways to improve the museum experience for kids, and it took a long time
         for us to decide how exactly what approach we wanted to take. However, after going through the entire process, I think we did a good job exploring many different avenues to tackle this issue.
