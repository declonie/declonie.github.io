        <p class="project-text">
          Our motivation for creating LG is a combination of several different factors. Prior to deciding to go with Life as a Gym glasses as our concept, we conducted background research in various topics; one of the statistics we found was approximately 40-50% of all college students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity, that is, they do not do enough physical activity in a given day to constitute exercise from a medical perspective. This statistic was a driving force throughout our project and stuck with us as one of our key motivations throughout the course. This statistic was found out after we completed the majority of the coursework, but we found it was a good justification that helped validate our design and concept.

        <p class="project-text">
          When we began this project, we had no previous knowledge or background information regarding what types of exercises are popular, or what resources are target audience uses when learning about exercise. Additionally, because we were in the beginning phases of the project we wanted to have quantitative evidence to help inform our future design decisions. With these two conditions, we decided a survey would be the best tool available to gather large quantities of data on our target audience, and the types of questions we needed to asked fit a survey format well. Through the use of our survey, we ended up finding several interesting insights that ended up serving is pillars throughout the rest of the project, they were:

           The goal of the diary study was to gain insight into the day-to-day exercise motivations and barriers that our participants faced. In particular, we were hoping to gain insight into novel barrier situations which could not accuratly be captured using a survey.  We chose to use a diary study because it allowed us to capture data over a series of days; this was advantageous because we didn't have to ask participants to recall a lot of information, they could instead give us direct answers based on their daily experience.

        <p class="project-text">
            Because the idea behind our technology is fairly new and not something most people have experienced, we wanted to gain more information about how they would expect the technology to behave in certain scenarios. To learn more about this, we created 8 scenarious which were each designed to solicit feedback about a particular feature or design decision. We created scenarious which tackled privacy, public exercise, trip planning, navigation, system input types (audio, touch, gesture), and more. These informed our design decisions in a major way, and ended up making re-think entire portions of our original system design due to feedbaack we receieved. For example, we changed the entire privacy system of the glasses based on how uncomfortable users felt while acting through the privacy-related scenario. The following are images showing how we conducted our enactment:

To create our new project proposals, we took all of the data we gathered from our diary studies and survey, and highlighted some of the key factors that appeared in both. These key factors included time management, endurance and strength training, and the need for guidance during exercise.</p>

        <p class="project-text">After this distillation, we began a second ideation phase where each group member would create new project concepts based on the information we learned; ideas were then shared, selected based on commonalities, and then fleshed out. We narrowed down to the three solutions based on feasibility and how close they aligned to the three key factors.</p>

            After taking our design concepts and putting them in front of other UX professionals and potential users, we decided to pursue our smart exercise glasses. We went in this direction for 2 reasons, first, time management was by far the most consistent issue found throughout our studies, and our smart exercise glasses addressed this problem best. Second, we wanted to take a different approach to solving this problem; smart gym equipment already exists, and we didn't feel we had a unique angle to make a difference.

            To create our prototype, we utilized a few technical tools. First, a framework called <strong>A-Frame, the backend of our system</strong>. A-Frame is a web-based VR framework, based on Javascript. It allows running a VR experience right in a browser window. In addition to this, we used an additional library call AR.js to add the AR layer and the ability to access the device camera. To duplicate allow users to experience our prototype, we used a Samsung Gear to create the experience.

          Additionally, we needed to create a set of mockup screens which we could then add to the AR layer of our prototype. These screens were the product of all of the research we conducted previously in this project, especially our User Enactments, where we had users directly look at our previous designs and provide feedback to us. These are samples of several of the prototype screens we made, additional screenshots can be seen in our <a href="http://google.com">interactive demo.</a>
