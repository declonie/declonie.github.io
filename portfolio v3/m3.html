      <p class="project-text"> Health Information Technology &amp; Services is a group within the University of Michigan Medical School, also known as Michigan Medicine. They manage all of the departmental
        websites for each program within Michigan Medicine, e.g. Physiology, Biology, etc. Our group was tasked with creating guidelines for each of these websites, to ensure that prospective
        PhD students were able to use them easily, and to guarantee they had the right type of content on each website.

        <h2 class="project-page">Interaction Map</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          The first task our group decided to tackle was creating an interaction map of one of their existing websites. Since we had no prior experience using these websites and were in general
          unfamiliar with the subject matter, the interaction map gave us an opportunity to learn more about the content of each website, how that content is structured, and also gave us a glimpse
          into some of the basic usability issues that were currently present on the website. Below is an image of how the "education section" is mapped out on the Emergency Medicine website.

          <h2 class="project-page">User Interviews </h2>
          <p class="project-text">
            Once the Interaction Map was complete, we needed to learn more about the users of these websites. To accomplish this, we conducted 5 user interviews with current PhD students who have either
            directly used the websites our client manages, or similar websites that other universities offer. The goal of the interviews was to learn how each participant used these types of websites when
            they were applying, specifically, we focused on the type of content each participant used and how helpful that content was for them to make a decision to pursue or pass on a PhD program. Additionally
            we spent a lot of time with each participant talking about their frustrations when using these kinds of websites. Lastly, we asked for feedback regarding how the content of the websites
            better suite their needs.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text">
            <strong>By conducting user interviews we learned the following things:</strong>
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="list-item"> Students have a lot of criteria when determining which programs to apply for</li>
              <li class="list-item"> Information regarding funding availability and earning funding is very important</li>
              <li class="list-item"> Academic websites aren't updated very frequently which causes a lot of frustration</li>
              <li class="list-item"> Students use other resources than the departmental websites to learn information, including current students and friends </li>
              <li class="list-item"> International students have a lot of unique challenges since they can't visit programs as easily</li>
            </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="project-text">
            <strong>To address these issues, our group recommended the following things:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
             <li class="list-item"> Align the content of each website with students key criteria for program selection</li>
             <li class="list-item"> Create funding sections on each website to ensure funding information is easy to access and understand</li>
             <li class="list-item"> Update each website periodically to ensure content is current</li>
             <li class="list-item"> Provide contact information for other students and faculty so students can reach out to them more easily</li>

          <h2 class="project-page">Comparative Evaluation </h2>
          <p class="project-text">
            After learning about our users through interviews, we conducted a comparative analysis to learn how our clients websites stack up against the competition. In order to conduct the analysis, we needed
            to first find one website that our client manages to use; in this case we chose the Molecular and Integrative Physiology website, as it had a lot of content on it compared to several of the others.
            We then selected the competitors we wished to compare our website against and categorized them based on how they were related to our product.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text">
            <strong>Each competitor and categorization can be seen below:</strong>

              After all of our compettors were identified, we came up with criteria which gave us a metric to compare each competitor by. The criteria we came up with were a combination
              of the feedback we heard during interviews and our own personal experiences using these types of websites.

            <p class="project-text">
              After completing our comparative analysis we moved on to creating an online survey. The goal of the survey was to dig deeper into a lot of the responses we got during
              the user interview portion of the project. Specifically, we focused a lot of our questions around what criteria students used to make their decision about a program,
              what information sources they use to learn about a program, how a department website can influence their perception of a program, and how outdated information impacts them.
              Additionally, we asked participants to rank several of the criteria from these questions based on how important they were to them so we could ascertain what to
              prioritize in the project moving forward.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              <strong>We sent our survey out to around 500 current PhD students and were able to get 34 responses in total. From these responses, we found the following things:</strong>
            </p>
              <ul>
                 <li class="list-item">Department websites are the most used information sources to learn about a program</li>
                 <li class="list-item">Department websites impact students' perceptions of a program, meaning it is important they make a good impression with prospective students</li>
                 <li class="list-item">Certain resources, such as faculty members and current students are seen as the most helpful resources, but they aren't used as much as other resources</li>
                 <li class="list-item">The criteria that is important to students changes between pre-enrollment and post-enrollment</li>
              </ul>
            <p class="project-text">
              <strong>To address these findings, we recommended the following things be done: </strong>

               <li class="list-item">Focus on making information on these websites easy to find and comprehensive</li>
               <li class="list-item">Adjust the content on each website to align with what current PhD students deem important since they have experience in the program</li>
               <li class="list-item">Include contact information for all faculty and current students since they are seen as the most helpful resource for prospective PhD students</li>

            <p class="project-text">
              After spending months learning about our users and what is important to them, we decided to shift our focus to conducting a heuristic evaluation of the molecular and integrative physiology website.
              The goal of are heuristic evaluation was to identify basic usability issues that can be seen throughout the website. We used Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics and modified them to better fit
              the goals and the scope of the project. For each heuristic, we added between 3 and 7 criteria that enabled us to evaluate the website in a “yes” or “no” manner.
            </p>

            <p class="project-text">
              The final assignment for this project was to perform a usability test on the Molecular and Integrative Physiology Website. The goal of doing a usability test was to
              get a firsthand look at how real users would actually use this website, and learn what worked well and what could be improved. In order to run a usability test, we needed to create a script that
              contained a series of tasks for our users to complete; we ended up modeling the majority of our tasks from the experiences that users shared with us throughout this project and how they told us
              they used the website when they were applying for PhD programs. Once the script was created, we recruited users for the testing. We were able to find 4 current PhD students that had never interacted
              with the MIP website, making them the ideal candidates since we wanted the testing to be based on their first experience.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              Each testing session had a moderator and a minimum of 2 note-takers who were observing the testing through screensharing on bluejeans. <strong>Note-takers were tasked with keeping track

              After conducting a semesters worth of research for Health Information Technology &amp; Services, we looked back at everything we learned and used that
              knowledge to create a series of guidelines which can be applied to each website to ensure they have the right content and structure for their users.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              <strong>Our guidelines included the following things:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li class="list-item">Include standard content on each website, such as:
