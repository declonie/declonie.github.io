        <p class="project-text"> ACE is a brand new customer experience application developed on the Salesforce framework, which specializes in giving our customer advocates a one-stop shop to answer member inquiries and guide our members on their health insurance journeys. One of the major goals of Ace is to combine the information of multiple programs that advocates currently use into one convenient location to help eliminate the need for using multiple systems and applications, which saves our advocates significant time and allows them to help more of our members in any given day.</p>

        <p class="project-text">
          The most important page in the ACE application is the member-centric dashboard. This is the first place a customer advocate will reach once a member is found within our systems, and it serves as both a major source of immediate information for an advocate, and also a jumping off point to various other area's of the application.

          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Membership and Demographic Information:</strong> Advocates have quick access to a myriad of information about our members to help quickly identify and service basic inquiries. Information auch as: Insurance Plan Information, Demographic Information, Contact and Address Information, and Related Famiy Members.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Benefit Information:</strong> Front and Center on the Dashboard is members benefit information, including deductibles for individual and family. Benefits show precise dollar amounts for various parts of a members plan, which helps advocates quickly answer several of our most frequently asked questions.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Claim Information:</strong> One of our leading call drivers is questions about claims. Advocates can quickly find claims a member is calling about, and then deep dive into specific claims to answer questions and deliver peace of mind.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Case Documentation:</strong> One of our advocates primary responsibilities is documenting why a member is calling; so we added the Cases and Interactons card to help them quickly document inquiries, and also have a quick record of any previous calls a member made.

        <p class="project-text">
          Claim details is the most important feature within ACE, and the most common phone call our customer advocates receive. This section of ACE lays out dozens of fields of information all related to the claim a provider has submitted to Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The information displayed goes far beyond what a typical member is sent; this allows our advocates to dig deeper into claims to answer any questions a member might have, or help discover problems with how a claim was processed.

            <strong>Difficult to Read and Find Information:</strong> Advocates complained the page was difficult to read due to the large amount of white space, 4 column grid, and hard to distinguish field labels.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
              <strong>Field Order is Unintuitive:</strong> The dozens of fields on the page appear to be in a random order and do not help advocates facilitate conversation with members.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
              <strong>Too Much Scrolling:</strong> Because all claims information is on one singular view, advocates had to scroll a lot to see different sections of the data.

        <ul class="project-list">

              <strong>New Page Layouts:</strong> I changed the layout on the pages to focus on single column structures that reduce eye movement and improve overall readability.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
              <strong>Reorganized Data:</strong> I performed a card sort with current and former advocates to determine the best order for fields to display on, allowing them to guide conversations naturally.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
              <strong>Added Tabs:</strong> To address the large amounts of scrolling, we split information off into its own tabs; this lets advocates quickly switch to relevant views based on what a member needs assistance with. This also helps cut down on needing to see unnecessary information while on a call with a member.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
              <strong>Added Search Functionality</strong> To help newer advocates find information, a search bar was added to the top of the page; giving advocates the ability to search for specific fields, and then highlighting them on the page to make finding relevant data easier.

          <li class="list-item">
            Everytime an advocate adds an additional code to check, they need to manually select the type of code, which adds extra clicks.

            Advocates have limits regarding number of codes they can search at once, but the system doesn't make them aware unless they exceed the limit.

          Engagement Opportunities are how we let our members know about additional services and programs we offer. These can range from reminding them to schedule an appointment for a routine physical, to letting them know about Gym Memberships and Diabetes management programs. There are hundreds of programs an advocate may be prompted to ask about, so we created a UI which showcases high priority opportunities, and helpful scripts for them to say to our members.

            <strong>Access to Top Priority Engagements:</strong> Advocates are able to view the top 3 opportunities we have for each member. In this example we have a Catastrophic Event, a Clinical Introduction, and a Campaign offer.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Useful Chat Scripts:</strong> Due to there being hundreds of different opportunities and programs, we created simple to follow scripts for our advocates. These help highlight the key points for each opportunity, and allow our advocates to enroll members if they are interested.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Automated Case Creation:</strong> When advocates select te members response, the system will automatically create cases for them in the background; this helps reduce their workflow substantially and allows them to assist additional members with their needs.
