          the current IVR system in place, and trying to find ways to help improve it through research, design, and heuristics. In particular, the business wanted us to focus on making the system easier to use since a large portion of the caller

        <p class="project-text">
          In order to evaluate and improve the IVR system, we first needed to map out how exactly
          the current system worked; unfortunately the documentation we received from the business was
          outdated and full of inconsistensies. We spent a few days
          calling the current IVR system and mapping each path and interaction which was required to proceed. To help speed up
          the process, we used a voice processing app called Otter; which gave us a live translation of the system, and then we simply needed to create the tree structure ourselves.
          After the mapping was complete, we were left with the following call tree structure.

          Like any other system, IVR's have core design principles that should be upheld for the best possible experience and usability. Sources such as Google Scholar helped us find articles
          showing the limits of human patience, ability to memorize and understand options, and mental fatigue. Industry leaders, such as Twilio, Helped
          break down simple best practices to follow when it comes to designing an IVR.
