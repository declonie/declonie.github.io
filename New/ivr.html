      <p class="project-text"> All business with customer service lines use a phone tree system of menus and options to help guide the caller to a specialist who can help them resolve their issues. For this project, we were tasked with examining the current IVR system in place, and trying to find ways to help improve it through research, design, and heuristics. In particular, the business wanted us to focus on making the system easier to use since a large portion of the caller demographic are adults over the age of 50.</p>

        <p class="project-text">
          In order to evaluate and improve the IVR system, we first needed to map out how exactly
          the current system worked; unfortunately the documentation we received from the business was
          outdated and full of inconsistensies with the current live system. We spent a few days
          calling the current IVR system and mapping each path and interaction which was required to proceed. To help speed up
          the process, we used a voice processing app called Otter; which gave us a live translation of the system, and then we simply needed to create the tree structure ourselves.
          After the mapping was complete, we were left with the following call tree structure.

        <p class="project-text">
          In order to evaluate the current IVR system, we needed to find a set of heuristics we could use.
          We took direction from two types of sources: scholarly and industy leaders. Sources such as Google Scholar helped us find articles
          showing the limits of human patience, ability to memorize and understand options, and mental fatigue. Industry leaders, such as Twilio, Helped
          break down simple best practices to follow when it comes to designing an IVR.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          <strong>Based on these sources, we created the following list of heuristics to evaluate our IVR system against:</strong>

        <ul class="project-list">
           <li class="list-item">Spoken prompts should be short in length, generally below 30 seconds is the industry standard</li>
           <li class="list-item">When users reach a decision point; they should have less than 5 options to choose from</li>
           <li class="list-item">Anytime a user needs to input information, the system should provide generoud timing to accomodate for elderly users or users with disabilities</li>
           <li class="list-item">Tone and Voice is important for IVR systems; the system needs to present itself in a friendly yet professional manner</li>

        <p class="project-text">
          <strong>To address these issues, we recommended taking the following actions:</strong>

          <p class="project-text">
            Once the Interaction Map was complete, we needed to learn more about the users of these websites. To accomplish this, we conducted 5 user interviews with current PhD students who have either
            directly used the websites our client manages, or similar websites that other universities offer. The goal of the interviews was to learn how each participant used these types of websites when
            they were applying, specifically, we focused on the type of content each participant used and how helpful that content was for them to make a decision to pursue or pass on a PhD program. Additionally
            we spent a lot of time with each participant talking about their frustrations when using these kinds of websites. Lastly, we asked for feedback regarding how the content of the websites
            better suite their needs.

          <p class="project-text">
            <strong>From our interviews, we were able to discover the following. Additional information can be found in the <a href="assets/files/interview.pdf" target="_blank"> User Interview Report</a></strong>

              Our final research objective was to perform a usability test on the Molecular and Integrative Physiology Website. The goal of doing a usability test was to
              get a firsthand look at how real users actually use this website, and learn what works well and what can be improved. In order to run a usability test, we needed to create a script that
              contained a series of tasks for our users to complete; we ended up modeling the majority of our tasks from the experiences that users shared with us throughout this project and how they told us
              they used the website when they were applying for PhD programs. Once the script was created, we recruited users for the testing. We were able to find 4 current PhD students that had never interacted
              with the MIP website, making them the ideal candidates since we wanted the testing to be based on their first experience.
