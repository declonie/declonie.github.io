          The most important page in the ACE application is the member-centric dashboard. This is the first place a customer advocate will reach once a member is found within our systems, and it serves as both a major source of immediate information for an advocate, and also a jumping off point to various other area's of the application.

            <strong>Membership and Demographic Information:</strong> Advocates have quick access to a myriad of information about our members to help quickly identify and service basic inquiries. Information auch as: Insurance Plan Information, Demographic Information, Contact and Address Information, and Related Famiy Members.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Benefit Information:</strong> Front and Center on the Dashboard is members benefit information, including deductibles for individual and family. Benefits show precise dollar amounts for various parts of a members plan, which helps advocates quickly answer several of our most frequently asked questions.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Claim Information:</strong> One of our leading call drivers is questions about claims. Advocates can quickly find claims a member is calling about, and then deep dive into specific claims to answer questions and deliver peace of mind.
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <strong>Case Documentation:</strong> One of our advocates primary responsibilities is documenting why a member is calling; so we added the Cases and Interactons card to help them quickly document inquiries, and also have a quick record of any previous calls a member made.

          Claim details is the most important feature within ACE, and the most common phone call our customer advocates receive. This section of ACE lays out dozens of fields of information all related to the claim a provider has submitted to Blue Cross and Blue Shield. The information displayed goes far beyond what a typical member is sent; this allows our advocates to dig deeper into claims to answer any questions a member might have, or help discover problems with how a claim was processed.

These can range from reminding them to schedule an appointment for a routine physical, to letting them know about Gym Memberships and Diabetes management programs.
