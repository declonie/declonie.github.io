        <p class="project-text">
          Traditional museums tend to focus on looking and reading; you walk up to and exhibit, look at it, read the information plaque, and do that 100 more times throughout the visit.
          The problem is, kids aren't engaged with the museum material because it's not presented to them in a form they enjoy. Tourtle was created to solve this problem, by helping present all of the same information
          in a form kids can digest and have fun with.

          Museums have been around for thousands of years, and there's a lot of great knowledge which we could take advantage of which helps describe the museum experience while also pointing out potential issues.
          To take advantage of all this information, we conducted literature reviews to specifically look at how the museum experience works for children. By utilizing tools such as Google Scholar, Jstor, and Elsevier, we found a plethora of valuable
          information which helped guide the rest of our research. The following quotes help summarize some of the information we found:
        </p>
        <p class="quote sidekick">
          “What children take away from their experiences is determined by a combination of what they do and what they talk about.”

          "The combination of hands‐on engagement with objects and elaborative talk during events may promote successful transfer"

          To gain better first-hand experience with how kids engage with museums, we decided to conduct observations at the Henry Ford Museum in Detroit, MI. We chose to observe at Henry Ford for two distinct reasons. First, the exhibits have a wide
          variety of interactions, from looking and reading, to touching and building. We were able to see first hand what types of experience kids gravitated towards and which experiences they dislikes. Second, families tend to be the main audience
          due to the subject matter of the museum, which meant we could see more about how parents interact with their kids and vice-versa.

          to learn about how their experience was. In particular, we wanted to focus on how going to the museum with a child affected their experience, how did they interact with their kids during the trip, and how museums can best improve their
          experiences for children. The following quotes were some of the responses we recieved from parents:

          The first step in our design process was ideation. The goal of the ideation phase was to generate as many ideas as possible which aligned with the design criteria we established. To help with this process, we decided to create a large
          matrix table which helped us create a plethora of different solutions. Using this method we were able to over 50 unique ideas which all had the potential to solve our design problem.

          After creating over 50 ideas, we needed to compare each idea against the criteria we previously established to see how well or poorly they met each. Examining each idea and talking about their strengths and weaknesses, helped us narrow down
          to three potential design concepts, they were:

          Once we decided on a concept, we began prototyping our idea to solicit feedback. For our first prototype, we used an electronics kit called LittleBits, and paired it with a toy bear stuffed animal. LittleBits allowed us to mimic the
          experience of listening to a story about a museum exhibit, by letting us play audio through a speaker when a button was pressed.

          After creating our prototype, we wanted to test it out with users and other UX professionals to get their opinion on it. As was expected, our prototype had several major concerns that needed to be addressed:

        <p class="project-text">
          Our original prototype ended up being over 2 lbs once all the components were inserted; making it tiresome to carry around all day for a kid.

          Too Big
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The bear we used for the prototype was approximately a foot tall; making it a pretty large object for a kid to be carrying arounf for the entire day.

        <p class="project-text">
          Due to the bear not having any other way to stay with their kid companion, there was concern it would get left behind as they explore the museum.

        <p class="project-text">
          After receieving feedback on our first prototype, we made many changes. We switched our stuffed animal to a much smaller slap-bracelet, which meant less weight and bulk to carry around. Using a slap bracelet also means the toy will always
          be attached to the kid, making it less of a burden on them. Secondly, we changed the technical implementation; we swapped out the LittleBits system in favor of an Arduino because of the added control and flexibility to the project.

        <p class="project-text">
          This project was unique because it revolved around the concept of improving the museum experience, which is not something I had much experience with before starting the project. However, that made the project
          more interesting, as I had the opportunity to learn about an entirely new field with its own set of rules and restrictions.
        </p>
        <p class="project-text">
          The toughest part of this project was narrowing down our solution concepts. There are so many possible ways to improve the museum experience for kids, and it took a long time
          for us to decide what approach to take. However, after going through the entire process, I believe we did a good job exploring many different avenues to tackle this issue.
