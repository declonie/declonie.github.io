        <p class="project-text">
          Our motivation for creating LG is a combination of several different factors. Prior to deciding to go with Life as a Gym glasses as our concept, we conducted background research in various topics; one of the statistics we found was
          approximately 40-50% of all college students do not get the recommended amount of physical activity, that is, they do not do enough physical activity in a given day to constitute exercise from a medical perspective. We found this statistic
          to be shocking, and we knew we could make a difference if we challenged this problem from a user experience point of view.

          also be a database for exercise sites that LG can access and provide recommendations based on the data it has.

          sometimes more frequent basis. We chose this type of research because we wanted to see how people's behaviors and motivations change from day-to-day when it comes to exercising. The diary study also helped us learn more about topics which
          cannot easily be tackled in a survey, due to the open-ended nature of the questions. Below is an example of the form we sent to respondents, and some of the data we received from our diary study.

          After narrowing down our ideation to our Life as a Gym concept, we needed to conduct additional research to flesh out the concept and discover our users thoughts and feelings regarding the AR/VR experience.
          To learn more about this we decided to conduct user enactments. User enactments have users going through a set of different real-world use case scenarios, and seeing how they understand and respond to the activities they perform. For our
          user enactments we created 8 scenarious which were each designed to solicit feedback about a particular feature or design decision. The subjects of these scenarios included privacy, public exercise, trip planning, navigation, system input
          types (audio, touch, gesture), and more.

          After conducting our user enactments, we took all of our notes, observation data, and feedback from users and created a series of around 200 affinity notes. We then took these notes and categorized them based on their content until we had a
          series of common themes.

        <h3 class="project-page"> New Design Direction </h3>
        <p class="project-text"> After finishing our second round of study, we realized that our design concept which we presented to users was deeply flawed. We re-examined all of our findings and our current system version, and determined that our
          current concept did not meet the expectation of our users in terms of functionality or usability. We decided to strip our current design of several features, such as the built-in social interaction aspect, and re-focused our concept into a
          much simpler, streamlines experience. With this new mindset, we worked on creating a prototype using AR to prove our concept. </p>
        <h3 class="project-page">Prototyping</h3>
        <p class="project-text">
          To create our prototype, we utilized a few technical tools. First, a framework called <strong>A-Frame, the backend of our system</strong>. A-Frame is a web-based VR framework, based on Javascript. It allows running a VR experience right in
          a browser window. In addition to this, we used an additional library call AR.js to add the AR layer and the ability to access the device camera. To duplicate allow users to experience our prototype, we used a Samsung Gear to create the
          experience.

        <p class="project-text">
          Additionally, we needed to create a set of mockup screens which we could then add to the AR layer of our prototype. These screens were the product of all of the research we conducted previously in this project, especially our User
          Enactments, where we had users directly look at our previous designs and provide feedback to us. These are samples of several of the prototype screens we made, additional screenshots can be seen in our <a
