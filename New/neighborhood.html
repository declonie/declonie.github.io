        <p class="project-text">
          The design team was approached to help improve the check in experience for a brand new endeavor the company was venturing into, community centers. The current check in process is outdated and was not
          properly thought through during the centers creation; they wanted us to do a full suite of both research and design to help improve this process.
          Additionally, we were asked to ensure our solution was scalable, efficient, easy to use, and consumer friendly.

          The main goal of our contextual inquiry was to gain a better understanding of how the current center's check in works. We spent an entire week at the center, making sure that we had enough time to fully observe guests, staff members,
          classes and activites, and of course
          our main focus, the check in process. We made sure to be present right as various types of classes and activities took place since this is when the current check in process was tested the most. Classes and activities are also when guests
          and staff members tend to interact
          and we wanted to see what their general interactions were, and if they had any effect on the check-in process.

          we also had a large emphasis on what brings guests into the center; this was to help gather data about the types of classes and activities which are most prevalent.

          Before we began actually designing, we created two separate sets of design principles based on our core user groups, staff and guests. We outlined the most important needs for each group based on the research findings. During the prototype
          creation phase,
          we constantly referenced the design principles to ensure we were staying focused on the most important needs for each user group.

        <p class="project-text">
          Before prototyping, we needed to lay out all of the various tasks users need to accomplish using our kiosk. We hosted a whiteboarding session with designers, researchers, and stakeholders to go over the tasks we could think of, and also
          gain additional input from other parties to see if there was anything we missed. After these sessions were held, we strung everything together into a flow diagram to determine what we would need to show in our prototype. A version of the
          flow diagram can be found below.

        <p class="project-text">We wanted to simulate a genuine check-in experience as best we could, including letting users have free control to input all of the information that they would normally put in during a check in process.
          This would help us get a realistic sense of how long these tasks would take for the average user, while also providing great feedback about their overall experience using our proposed solution.</p>
        <p class="project-text">To create our prototype we relied on using Axure, which is a tool we typically don't use due to its complexity and steep learning curve,
          but once the program is learned it offers a much wider array of interactions than any other prototyping software on the market. </p>
