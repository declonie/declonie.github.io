      <h2 class="project-page">How Tutor Time Works</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        Tutor Time was designed to be a simple, straightforward process to match students up with prospective students. Once a user has created an account, they are taken to their dashboard where they are given a few different options, with the main options being "Post a Question" and "Solve a Question." For this scenario, lets say a student has a question they need help answering, they click to post their question, and get taken to a screen which has them enter in a little bit more information about their question, such as what subject it pertains to, the question itself, and any additional information the student wants to include. The question is then put into a list where any available students and tutors with expertise in that subject can see the question and determine if they are able to help the student. If they can help, the two are matched up and put into a private messaging room where they can go over and discuss the problem and how to solve it.

      <p class="project-text">
          Tutor Time is an application I designed that helps connect high school students with qualified and knowledgable tutors. The application is designed to work similarly to a text messaging service, where students can work collaboratively on their homework or other academic goals with a tutor. By focusing on a smart phone application, Tutor Time is a new way to help students learn without having to work through in-person tutoring
          sessions.

      <p class="project-text">
          Creating Tutor Time was a difficult process which involced conducting user research using several different methods, and also using an iterative design process which cycled around ideation and feedback to create the final applications design.

      <h2 class="project-page"> Background Research </h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        The first step in this project was to find a project space and conduct background research and secondary anlysis. I specifically wanted to learn more information regarding students who fall behind in school and struggle to grasp new material. Luckily, education is a highly explored topic, so finding great research wasn't an issue. After looking through many academic papers and articles from source such as PewResearch, Harvard, and statistics from the U.S. government, I was able to understand the struggles students face. Additionally, because I've been a student my entire life, I've been able to see several of the issues with how students struggle throughout their academic lives.

      <p class="project-text">
          Once background research was complete, I decided to move onto the most important part of this project, conducting user interviews with current and former students to learn more about their academic endeavors. Specifically, I wanted
          to learn more about times when they were struggling to complete a homework assignment or failed to grasp new materials they were learning. Additionally, I wanted to gain a better understanding
          about which tools and resources they had used, and gauge how effective they were at helping students out. After conducting user interviews, I was able to create 3 different personas that
          helped serve as a guide for the rest of the design process.

      <p class="project-text">
        With the initial set of research completed, and a set of target users in mind, I decided to start working on the ideation phase of the project. For this ideation phase, I wanted to generate a lot of unique ideas to help solve this problem, so I decided to not limit myself to real-world solutions, and just come up with anything that came to my mind. I could then take the best parts of each idea and combine them together into a new solution. From the ideation phase, I created 8 unique potential solutions to help address the problem, they were:

        <p class="project-text">
          I then moved onto thinking about how users would use some of these ideas, so I created multiple storyboards to outline the process and show how each idea can help them meet their goals.

        <h2 class="project-page"> Narrowing the Selection </h2>
        <p class="project-text"> After going through the ideation phase of the project, it was time to narrow down to one concept for prototyping and testing. I decided a smartphone application would be a great way to do this, since during my user interviews it came up as a device which many people already use to solicit help. Smartphone apps also have the advantage of being portable, which would enable students to get help anywhere at anytime.</p>

            With the ideal solution chosen, I decided to work on paper-prototyping our the concepts. By creating paper prototypes first, I was able to create and modify screens quickly and easily to test several types of layouts. I used the data I gathered to model different scenarios users would have when interacting with the app, and then created screens to best fulfill their needs. Below are samples of the original paper prototypes:

        <p class="project-text">
          After paper prototypes were created, I moved onto the next step in the design process, usability testing.
          I needed to test them out with members of my target audience to gather valuable feedback and insights about what works, what doesn't, and what I can do to improve the experience.
          I found several participants to go through the testing sessions with; each participant went through 10 small tasks that could be accomplished by my application.

          Key Insights from Usability Testing:
        </h3>
        <p class="project-text">
          The usability testing sessions revealed a lot of helpful information regarding my current designs. For the most part, participants were able to accomplish the tasks I asked of them, but there were several instances
          where the experience became either confusing or frustrating. I used these instances to gather as much feedback as possible, and actively sought out advice from my participants on how to fix any issues they came across.
          With their help, I refined my paper prototypes and made changes based on the feedback given. The images below shows how certain screens were modified to help alleviate some confusion.

          This image shows the changes made to the rating system in the application, the original rating system was done using letter grades like a professor would give a student.
