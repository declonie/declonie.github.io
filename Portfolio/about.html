				  <p><strong>Education and Experience: </strong> My name is Tim Decloniemaclennan. I'm a graduate of MIchigan State University, earning degrees in Media & Information, as well as a degree in Creative Advertising. I am a former intern of the Usability/Accessibility Research and Consulting group (UARC) at Michigan State University, where my role was to use the Web Content Accessibility Guidleines (WCAG 2.0) to evaluate websites concerning accessibility and usability. My time there made me an expert in accessible technologies, focused on accessible websites and applications. I use the knowledge I've gained in usability and accessibility to make applications, websites, and other technologies easier to use for all users. </p>
                  <p> After finishing my internship at UARC, I was fortunate enough to earn a user research position on General Motors' (GM) usability team. During my time with GM, I was tasked with researching and conducting usability tests on their in vehicle entertainment systems. Additionally, I also evaluated in-vehicle systems for accessibility compliance using WCAG 2.0 guidelines. 
                  </p>
			 	  <p><strong>Hobbies and Interests: </strong> Aside from school and my career, I'm a massive Red Wings Fan, and try to go to a few games every season. I enjoy playing video games, but I also enjoy discussing video games, specifically how their user interfaces impact gameplay and the overall experience. Recently, I've developed a passion for exercising and I've spent the last few months of my life focusing on health and well being.   				</p>
