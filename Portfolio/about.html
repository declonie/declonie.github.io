      <h2 class="project-page">A little about me...</h2>
      <p class="project-text">
        Two years ago, I came to the University of Michigan hoping to change my life and my career, and I've successfully accomplished both. I'm now the proud holder of a Master's degree in Human Computer Interaction, where I specialize in User Experience Design and Research. In my past I've also earned two bachelor's degree from Michigan State University, where I studied the art of media communication and creative advertising.
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-page">Why User Experience?</h2>
      <p class="project-text">Have you ever experienced one of those moments in your life where your using or doing something and get frustrated to no end because you know it can be better or easier? This is the force that drove me into becoming a User Experience professional. I believe everything in this world can be improved, as long as things are approached with the right mindset and data. Luckily, this is the driving force behind User Experience; where you go out and learn about the real problems of people, examine them critically, and then try to craft unique and creative solutions to solve their problems. I've been doing this for over 3 years, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>

      <p class="project-text">My first time ever doing anything User Experience related came to me when I stumbled upon an internship focused on creating accessible websites. At the time, I had no idea what that meant; aren't all websites accessible? I can open them up in my browser just fine, so what's the problem? I was intrigued about the position, so I decided to apply, and that's when I quickly learned how big an idiot I am. Apparently, accessible meant creating a website so anyone can use it, regardless of any disabilities or impairments they may have. At this point your probably wondering how I got that job, right? Me too, I still don't know why they hired me, but they did, and I couldn't be more greatful. Little did I know that internship would be the foundation and spark that got me interested in the User Experience field.
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-page"> What else do I do? </h2>
      <p class="project-text"> Work and school are great, but I also love to enjoy my free time hanging out with great friends, going to red wings games, solving escape rooms, and traveling</p>
