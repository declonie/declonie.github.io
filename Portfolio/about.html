        <h2 class="project-page">A little about me...</h2>
        <p class="project-text">
          Two years ago, I came to the University of Michigan hoping to change my life and my career, and I've successfully accomplished both. I'm now the proud holder of a Master's degree in Human Computer Interaction, where I specialize in User Experience Design and Research. In my past I've also earned two bachelor's degree from Michigan State University, where I studied the art of media communication and creative advertising.

      <h2 class="project-page">Why User Experience?</h2>
      <p class="project-text">Have you ever experienced one of those moments in your life where your using or doing something and get frustrated to no end because you know it can be better or easier? This is the force that drove me into becoming a User Experience professional. I believe everything in this world can be improved, as long as things are approached with the right mindset, data, and creativity. Luckily, this is the driving force behind User Experience; where you go out and learn about the real problems of people, examine them critically, and then try to craft unique and creative solutions to solve their problems. I've been doing this for over 3 years, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.</p>

      <h2 class="project-page"> What makes me different? </h2>
      <p class="project-text"> User experience is a field where you get to go out, talk with people, and design solutions to their problems. We try to be the first ones in the world to create cutting edge designs, or target the most popular audiences on the planet. The problem is, in our quest to design for the majority, we often forget about other user groups, in particular those with accessibility issues. I challenge that notion, I've been trained extensively in accessible design, and I use those principles in everything I design to make sure all users are accounted for. Even this website has many accessibility features to help make it easier for those which rely on assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-page"> What else do I do? </h2>
      <p class="project-text"> I love the UX field, but I also love to enjoy life. When I'm not at work, I'm often hunting around for new escape rooms to break out of, going to sporting events (Let's Go Red Wings), or hanging out with some of the best friends a guy can have. I also try to explore a new city or country at least once a year, which has led to some amazing experiences.</p>
