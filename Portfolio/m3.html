          The first task our group decided to tackle was creating an interaction map of one of their existing websites. Since we had no prior experience using these websites and were in general
          unfamiliar with the subject matter, the interaction map gave us an opportunity to learn more about the content of each website, how that content is structured, and also gave us a glimpse
          into some of the basic usability issues that were currently present on the website. Below is an image of just one section of one of the websites we mapped out.

          <p class="project-text">
            Once the Interaction Map was complete, we needed to learn more about the users of these websites. To accomplish this, we conducted 5 user interviews with current PhD students who have either
            directly used the websites our client manages, or similar websites that other universities offer. The goal of the interviews was to learn how each participant used these types of websites when
            they were applying, specifically, we focused on the type of content each participant used and how helpful that content was for them to make a decision to pursue or pass on a PhD program. Additionally
            we spent a lot of time with each participant talking about their frustrations when using these kinds of websites. Lastly, we asked for feedback regarding how the content of the websites
            better suite their needs.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text">
            <strong>From our interviews, we were able to discover the following. Additional information can be found in the <a href="files/interview.pdf" target="_blank"> User Interview Report</a></strong>

            <ul>
              <li class="list-item"> Students have a lot of criteria when determining which programs to apply for</li>

            After learning about our users through interviews, we conducted a comparative analysis to learn how our clients websites stack up against the competition. In order to conduct the analysis, we needed
            to first determine which website
            We then selected the competitors we wished to compare our website against and categorized them based on how they were related to our product.

              After completing our comparative analysis we moved on to creating an online survey. The goal of the survey was to dig deeper into the responses we got during
              the user interview portion of the project. Specifically, we focused many of our questions around what criteria students used to make their decision about a program,
              what information sources they use to learn about a program, how a department website can influence their perception of a program, and how outdated information impacts them.
              Additionally, we asked participants to rank several of the criteria from these questions based on how important they were to them so we could ascertain what to
              prioritize in the project moving forward.
            </p>
            <p class="project-text">
              We sent our survey out to around 500 current PhD students and were able to get 34 responses in total. From these responses, the following are samples of the data we collected.

              After spending months learning about our users and what is important to them, we decided to shift our focus to conducting a heuristic evaluation of the Molecular and Integrative Physiology website.
              The goal of are heuristic evaluation was to identify basic usability issues that can be seen throughout the website. We used Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics and modified them to better fit
              the goals and the scope of the project. For each heuristic, we added between 3 and 7 criteria that enabled us to evaluate the website in a “yes” or “no” manner.

              Our final research objective was to perform a usability test on the Molecular and Integrative Physiology Website. The goal of doing a usability test was to
              get a firsthand look at how real users actually use this website, and learn what works well and what can be improved. In order to run a usability test, we needed to create a script that
              contained a series of tasks for our users to complete; we ended up modeling the majority of our tasks from the experiences that users shared with us throughout this project and how they told us
              they used the website when they were applying for PhD programs. Once the script was created, we recruited users for the testing. We were able to find 4 current PhD students that had never interacted

              knowledge to create a series of guidelines which can be applied to each website to ensure they have the right content and structure for their users. Determining which criteria to include in the guidelines was challenging, but we relied on what users echoed throughout the project.

              <strong>Our guidelines included the following:</strong>
