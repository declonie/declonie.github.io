                 <p>The past 3 years, I've been training and learning the role User Experience plays in web and application design. I ran over twenty studies during my time at General Motors, and I've learned more about UX from every single one. Running these studies has given me skills in script writing, moderating, report generating, and creating design recommendations that reflect the feedback that I've been given by thousands of consumers.</p>
                 <p>My time at General Motors also gave me good insight into the design part of User Experience. I worked closely with over 40 designers and would go through each step of the design process with them. This included helping with wire framing, conducting heuristic reviews on their designs, benchmarking out current designs against our competitors, and assessing their designs based on the consumer research that I did. </p>
