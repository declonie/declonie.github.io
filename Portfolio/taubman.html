            <h2> Project Description:</h2>
            <p> The Taubman Health Sciences Library (Taubman) is an academic research library at the University of Michigan
              (UM). Taubman serves the research and information needs of all health sciences-related schools, colleges, and
              departments at UM. Informationists at Taubman aim to take an active part in faculty research efforts, in addition
              to supporting the needs of health sciences students at UM.

            <h3> Project Goal &amp; Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Our group was tasked with finding ways to increase communication and foster collaboration between Taubman
              and a specific department at the University of Michigan Medical School—the Department of Learning Health Sciences (DLHS). To investigate this problem,
              we conducted background research on related issues and held a total
              of seven interviews with informationists, DLHS faculty researchers, and administrators in both institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>By conducting contextual interviews, we discovered the following key findings:</strong>
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Informationists are overworked and overwhelmed </li>
                <li> There are communication breakdowns between Taubman and the DLHS </li>
                <li> "Services" and "Collaboations" are seen as two different things</li>
                <li> Funding limits collaborative efforts</li>
                <li> DLHS faculty lack understanding of Taubman and the roe of Informationists</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>To address these key findings, we recommend the following:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Consider hiring additional informationists to alleviate the workload of current informationists</li>
              <li>Conduct a thorough review of the workload of each informationist to identify ways to reduce or
                  redistribute work</li>
              <li>Revise the Taubman website to include detailed descriptions of each informationist</li>
              <li>Standardize communication practices between informationists and researchers;
                  Possible methods include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Creating more formal and informal social events</li>
                    <li>Developing an online database of the informationists CVs</li>
                    <li>Requiring faculty researchers to attend informationist’s office hours</li>
                    <li>Mutually agree upon what level of service or collaboration merits acknowledgement on published
                        research</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Stage 1 - Background Research</h3>
            <p>
              To better understand our client and our client’s issue, our group performed initial background research into both
              Taubman and the DLHS prior to conducting our interviews. We examined current business to business communication methods,
              a scholarly literature review on best practices between academic libraries and researchers, and a scholarly literature review about collaboration in research.
              By performing this background research we were able to better understand our client and their position within the University of Michigan.
            </p>

            <h3> Stage 2 - Contextual Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              Our interview participants consisted of two informationists, three faculty researchers, one administrator from
              Taubman, and one administrator from the DLHS with varying levels of seniority in their respective departments
              and were selected with assistance from our client. Present at every interview were two group members who either
              took on the role of interviewer/moderator or notetaker. Each interview took place in our interview participant’s
              workspace and is composed of an informal question-and-answer session followed by an observation period. Each
              interview was 60-90 minutes in duration resulting in approximately 525 minutes of data.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the question-and-answer period, we focused on gathering an understanding of an informationist’s role
              from both their own perspective and from the perspective of a DLHS faculty researchers. From there, we specifically
              inquired about the existing relationships and potential for future collaborations between informationists and
              researchers. During the observation phase, we watched our interview participants at work and would ask the
              occasional questions to gain better understanding about their methodologies and workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our final interview was with an administrator at the DLHS and was conducted to understand how they—as
              someone who isn’t actively participating in the exchange between informationists and faculty researchers—viewed
              the current relationship between both parties and what they are doing to facilitate more communication and
              collaboration.

              <h3> Stage 3 - Data Analysis </h3>
              <p>
                Following each interview, our group would gather to debrief with one another and discuss our findings about the
                underlying principles and issues we observed. Additionally, the interviews were broken down into key data points
                about distinct findings and observations which were then individually recorded onto a post-it note. From seven
                interviews, we gathered approximately 500 interpretation notes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using an affinity wall, we grouped the notes by similarity to find commonalities among the interviews and to
                reveal key points and challenges about our client’s issue. This process was iterated a total of three times until we
                determined five fundamental high level themes which represent the core concerns regarding our client’s issue, the
                breakdowns in communication, and the constraints to workflow and quality. Our team then brainstormed several
                workable recommendations based on both these discoveries and on our initial background research.
              </p>
              <p><strong> Below is an image of the affinity wall we created using notes from our interviews</strong></p>

                </a>
                <p>
                  By constructing our affinity wall, we were able to learn the following:
