            <h2> Project Description:</h2>
            <p> Health Information Technology &amp; Services is a group within the University of Michigan Medical School, also known as Michigan Medicine. They manage all of the departmental
              websites for each program within Michigan Medicine, e.g. Physiology, Biology, etc. Our group was tasked with creating guidelines for each of these websites, to ensure that prospective
              PhD students were able to use them easily, and to guarantee they had the right type of content on each website.

            <h3> Overview</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>To accomplish our goal of creating guidelines for these departmental websites, our group used a wide variety of User Experience Research techniques, including:</strong>
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Interaction Map </li>
                <li> User Interviews </li>
                <li> Comparative/Competitive Analysis </li>
                <li> Online Surveys</li>
                <li> Heuristic Evaluation</li>
                <li> Usability Testing</li>
              </ul>
            <p>
              After executing all of these research methods, we were able to gain a better understanding of our target population, and were able to write guidlines in regards to the
              content that should be present on each website and how that content should be displayed.
            </p>

            <h3> Stage 1 - Interaction Map</h3>
            <p>
              The first task our group decided to tackle was creating an interaction map of one of their existing websites. Since we had no prior experience using these websites and were in general
              unfamiliar with the subject matter, the interaction map gave us an opportunity to learn more about the content of each website, how that content is structured, and also gave us a glimpse
              into some of the basic usability issues that were currently present on the website. Below is an image of how the "education section" is mapped out on the Emergency Medicine website.

              <h3> Stage 2 - User Interviews </h3>
              <p>
                Once the Interaction Map was complete, we needed to learn more about the users of these websites. To accomplish this, we conducted 5 user interviews with current PhD students who have either
                directly used the websites our client manages, or similar websites that other universities offer. The goal of the interviews was to learn how each participant used these types of websites when
                they were applying, specifically, we focused on the type of content each participant used and how helpful that content was for them to make a decision to pursue or pass on a PhD program. Additionally
                we spent a lot of time with each participant talking about their frustrations when using these kinds of websites. Lastly, we asked for feedback regarding how the content of the websites
                better suite their needs.
              <p>
                <strong>By conducting user interviews we learned the following things:</strong>
              </p>
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Students have a lot of criteria when determining which programs to apply for</li>
                  <li> Information regarding funding availability and earning funding is very important</li>
                  <li> Academic websites aren't updated very frequently which causes a lot of frustration</li>
                  <li> Students use other resources than the departmental websites to learn information, including current students and friends </li>
                  <li> International students have a lot of unique challenges since they can't visit programs as easily</li>
                </ul>
              <p>
                <strong>To address these issues, our group recommended the following things:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Align the content of each website with students key criteria for program selection</li>
                <li> Create funding sections on each website to ensure funding information is easy to access and understand</li>
                <li> Update each website periodically to ensure content is current</li>
                <li> Provide contact information for other students and faculty so students can reach out to them more easily</li>
                <li> Create a Frequently Asked Questions section to help students get answers to commonly asked questions</li>
              </ul>

              <h3> Stage 3 - Comparative Evaluation </h3>
              <p>
                After learning about our users through interviews, we conducted a comparative analysis to learn how our clients websites stack up against the competition. In order to conduct the analysis, we needed
                to first find one website that our client manages to use; in this case we chose the Molecular and Integrative Physiology website, as it had a lot of content on it compared to several of the others.
                We then selected the competitors we wished to compare our website against and categorized them based on how they were related to our product.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Each competitor and categorization can be seen below:</strong>

          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-8">
                <p>
                  After all of our compettors were identified, we came up with criteria which gave us a metric to compare each competitor by. The criteria we came up with were a combination
                  of the feedback we heard during interviews and our own personal experiences using these types of websites.``

                <ul>
                  <li>There is "standard" content that needs to be on the website, such as curriculum information</li>
                  <li>Some content, such as a Frequently Asked Questions page and an Alumni Placement page would help the MIP website standout amongst its competitors</li>
                  <li>International students should have a section dedicated to them on the website to help with their unique challenges</li>
                  <li>Add multiple ways to sort faculty members, such as by name or by research focus</li>
                  <li>The MIP website does a fairly good job compared to its competitors as a whole</li>

                <h3> Stage 4 - Online Surveys </h3>
                <p>
                  After completing our comparative analysis we moved on to creating an online survey. The goal of the survey was to dig deeper into a lot of the responses we got during
                  the user interview portion of the project. Specifically, we focused a lot of our questions around what criteria students used to make their decision about a program,
                  what information sources they use to learn about a program, how a department website can influence their perception of a program, and how outdated information impacts them.
                  Additionally, we asked participants to rank several of the criteria from these questions based on how important they were to them so we could ascertain what to
                  prioritize in the project moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>We sent our survey out to around 500 current PhD students and were able to get 34 responses in total. From these responses, we found the following things:</strong>
                </p>
                  <ul>
                  	<li>Department websites are the most used information sources to learn about a program</li>
                  	<li>Department websites impact students' perceptions of a program, meaning it is important they make a good impression with prospective students</li>
                  	<li>Certain resources, such as faculty members and current students are seen as the most helpful resources, but they aren't used as much as other resources</li>
                  	<li>The criteria that is important to students changes between pre-enrollment and post-enrollment</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>To address these findings, we recommended the following things be done: </strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focus on making information on these websites easy to find and comprehensive</li>
                  <li>Adjust the content on each website to align with what current PhD students deem important since they have experience in the program</li>
                  <li>Include contact information for all faculty and current students since they are seen as the most helpful resource for prospective PhD students</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
          </div>

                <h3> Stage 5 - Heuristic Evaluation </h3>
                <p>
                  After spending months learning about our users and what is important to them, we decided to shift our focus to conducting a heuristic evaluation of the molecular and integrative physiology website.
                  The goal of are heuristic evaluation was to identify basic usability issues that can be seen throughout the website. We used Jakob Nielsen's 10 heuristics and modified them to better fit
                  the goals and the scope of the project. For each heuristic, we added between 3 and 7 criteria that enabled us to evaluate the website in a “yes” or “no” manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>A breakdown of each heuristic and the criteria can be seen below.</strong>

                </a>
                <p>
                  <strong>From our evaluation, we learned the following things:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Determing where a user is on the website can sometimes be difficult to due the navigation now functioning properly</li>
                  <li>There are many styling inconsistensies on the MIP website, including link styles and heading colors</li>
                  <li>The built-in search functionality on the website is flawed and needs to be improved</li>
                  <li>However, despite these flaws, the MIP website is well organized and user friendly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>To address these issues, we recommended taking the following actions:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Change the navigation so it always shows exactly where a user is within the system</li>
                  <li>Create standards for all visual elements on the website</li>
                  <li>When users use the search functionality, it should include predictive text, more helpful error messages, and help users recover from errors such as mis-spellings</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Stage 6 - Usability Testing </h3>
                <p>
                  The final assignment for this project was to perform a usability test on the Molecular and Integrative Physiology Website. The goal of doing a usability test was to
                  get a firsthand look at how real users would actually use this website, and learn what worked well and what could be improved. In order to run a usability test, we needed to create a script that
                  contained a series of tasks for our users to complete; we ended up modeling the majority of our tasks from the experiences that users shared with us throughout this project and how they told us
                  they used the website when they were applying for PhD programs. Once the script was created, we recruited users for the testing. We were able to find 4 current PhD students that had never interacted
                  with the MIP website, making them the ideal candidates since we wanted the testing to be based on their first experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each testing session had a moderator and a minimum of 2 note-takers who were observing the testing through screensharing on bluejeans. <strong>Note-takers were tasked with keeping track
                  of the following information:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Path taken to complete the task</li>
                  <li>Duration of each task</li>
                  <li>Quotes spoken by the user</li>
                  <li>Observations regarding struggles</li>
                  <li>Post-task ratings and reasonings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>After the usability testing was complete, we learned the following things:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Faculty filter functionality lacks text telling users if it sorts by first or last name</li>
                  <li>The MIP website search functionality is inconsistent and not very helpful</li>
                  <li>The current financial information listed is not helpful</li>
                  <li>There are several pages with no content on them, which confuses users into thinking the website is broken</li>
                  <li>Faculty Page information needs to be more up-to-date</li>
                  <li>The relationship between the department and the overall program isn't very clear</li>
                  <li>Some page content doesn't align with user expectations, such as the curriculum page not having classes listed on it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>To address these issues, our group proposed the following solutions:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Provide Instructions for filtering mechanisms on the website</li>
                  <li>Improve search functionality to include more relevant results</li>
                  <li>Create a section on the website dedicated to financial information and include information students need in it</li>
                  <li>Modify or Remove pages with no content on them to alleviate confusion</li>
                  <li>Makesure faculty pages have up-to-date content on them and show users it is updated via a timestamp</li>
                  <li>Make the relationship between the department and program more well known</li>
                  <li>Change page content to align with student expectations</li>

                <h3> Stage 7 - Guideline creation &amp; video presentation </h3>
                <p>
                  After conducting a semesters worth of research for Health Information Technology &amp; Services, we looked back at everything we learned and used that
                  knowledge to create a series of guidelines which can be applied to each website to ensure they have the right content and structure for their users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Our guidelines included the following things:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Include standard content on each website, such as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Curriculum Information</li>
                      <li>Funding Information</li>
                      <li>Faculty Bio Pages</li>
                      <li>Faculty Research Focus</li>
                      <li>Application Information</li>
                      <li>About Us</li>
                      <li>Program Overview</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Update information each year, preferably before most students begin their research and applications</li>
                  <li>Explain the relationship between each department and the overall program on the website</li>
                  <li>Align the content on each website with user expectations</li>
                  <li>Ensure each website has contact information for faculty and current students</li>
                </ul>
