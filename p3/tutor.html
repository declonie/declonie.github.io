            <h2> Project Description:</h2>
            <p> Tutor time is a conceptual application geared towards high school students to help them with their homework.
              The main concept of the application is pairing up students with available tutors, and having them work collaboratively on homework
                or other academic goals.
            </p>
            <h2> Application Demo:</h2>
              <p> A basic demonstration of the application's key features can be found <a href="https://invis.io/7YEYTODGB" target="_blank">here</a></p>

            <h2 class="my-2"> The Design Process</h2>
            <h3> Stage 1 - Project Conceptualization </h3>
            <p> Tutor Time was created as a project for SI 582 - Introduction to interaction design. Our goal was to
              create a digital product (website or mobile application) that helps solve a problem for a community of
              our choice. The community I chose is high school students that struggle in school. This community was chosen because high schoolers face unique challenges, and I wanted to create an application that both
              helped those who need it, and requires me as a designer to get out of my comfort zone and try working
              on something different.
              </p>
            <h3> Stage 2 - Ideation Phase:</h3>
              <p> After deciding to work with high schoolers that need help in school, I began the ideation phase of the project. The goal of this phase was to come up with as many ideas as possible with no regard for technical limitations or realism. Below is a small sample of the ideas I came up with for this project.</p>

            <h3> Stage 3 - Ideation Refinement &amp; Storyboards</h3>
            <p> After coming up with several ideas, it was time to solicit feedback and refine
                them into more concrete and realistic solutions. To do this, we split up into small teams
                and each critiqued each others ideas and offered suggestions for improvement. These suggestions helped narrow down my application into real-world concepts which can be seen the storyboards.

              <h3> Stage 4 - User Interviews </h3>
              <p>
                Normally, this step would occur much earlier in the design process, but for this project user interviews came later so ideas
                and concepts were not constrained by real world users. I was able to get ahold of several current middle and high school students
                and ask them about the unique challenges they face, what their frustrations are, and how things could be improved. My findings were as follows:
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Keeping up with workloads is difficult </li>
                  <li> Students who fall behind tend to stay behind </li>
                  <li> Learning disabilities make homework and exams very difficult </li>
                  <li> Students learn best from their peers or when receiving individualized attention </li>

              <h3> Stage 5 - Persona Creation </h3>
              <p>
                After learning about my users needs and frustrations through interviews, I was able to take that information and create 5 persona's that helped
                me, as a UX designer, think about how real people would actually use my application. Additionally I also created one anti-persona to show that some
                users have no need for this application.

                <h3> Stage 6 - Paper Prototype </h3>
                <p>
                  The next step in the design process was to create paper prototypes based on all of the feedback and research that had been previously done.
                  The goal of the paper prototyping was to simply get my ideas down on paper, and start to get an idea of what content would be present on each
                  screen. I created screens that could be used to complete 10 unique tasks using the application, these tasks include...
                </p>
                  <ul>
                  	<li>Create a profile</li>
                  	<li>Use the camera function during the profile creation</li>
                  	<li>Post a problem</li>
                  	<li>Type in the chat</li>
                  	<li>End the session</li>
                  	<li>Leave a rating</li>
                  	<li>View your profile</li>
                  	<li>Look at a previously solved problem so you can study it</li>
                  	<li>Go through the "Solve a problem” process</li>
                  	<li>Use the drawing function to respond to a persons problem.</li>
                  </ul>

                <h3> Stage 7 - Peer Usability Testing </h3>
                <p>
                  Before being able to test my paper prototypes with actual participants, I solicited feedback from my peers to catch any
                  major usability issues so they could be fixed before actual testing. During these sessions we conducted a mock usability test where participants
                  would go through each of the 10 previous tasks while I observed as a moderator and a note taker.
                </p>
                <p>The peer usability testing helped iron out some of the issues with my first design attempt. The participants I had for this testing felt that several
                   elements used within the design, such as text entry areas and the general icon tray at the bottom were too large and taking up too much real-estate and attention
                   from the actual content of the app.
                </p>
                <p>After gathering feedback from the usability testing, the following changes were made:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Placeholder text was added to typing areas to help make their functionality more apparent to users </li>
                  <li> The area to send messages when working on a problem was changed to be inline with all the other icons.</li>
                  <li> Icons were scaled down to take up less screen room </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-lg-8">
                <h3> Stage 8 - Usability Testing </h3>
                <p>
                  Once all the changes were made to my paper prototypes, it was time to test the prototypes with potential users. For these tests, I found two participants
                  that had no prior relationship to the project. They performed the 10 tasks as the previous versions and provided feedback based on their experiences.
                </p>
                <p>The usability testing revealed a few issues with my current design. The biggest issue found was
                   the rating system that was being used after a session was complete. My original design used grades to rate the people who helped you on a scale from A to F, but during
                   the testing it became apparent that participants had no idea what the scale was supposed to represent and found it confusing to use in general.
                </p>
                <p>After gathering feedback from the usability testing, the following changes were made:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> The rating systems were changed from a grading scale to a more conventional star based system to help alleviate confusion</li>
                  <li> The "microphone" and "webcam" icons were changed to better represent their functionality</li>
                </ul>

                <h3> Stage 9 - Medium/High Fidelity Prototype </h3>
                <p>
                  After two rounds of usability testing, I transitioned from low fidelity paper prototypes to medium/high fidelity digital prototypes. To accomplish this, I
                  used Adobe Illustrator for all my screen designs and InvisionApp to link them all together into a functioning prototype.
