            <h2> Project Description:</h2>
            <p> Tutor time is a conceptual application geared towards high school students to help them with their homework.
              The main concept of the application is pairing up students with available tutors, and having them work collaboratively on homework
                or other academic goals.
            </p>
            <h2> Application Demo:</h2>
              <p> A basic demonstration of the application's key features can be found <a href="https://invis.io/7YEYTODGB" target="_blank">here</a></p>

            <h2 class="my-2"> The Design Process</h2>
            <h3> Stage 1 - Project Conceptualization </h3>
            <p> Tutor Time was created as a project for SI 582 - Introduction to interaction design. Our goal was to
              create a digital product (website or mobile application) that helps solve a problem for a community of
              our choice. The community I chose is high school students that struggle in school. This community was chosen because high schoolers face unique challenges, and I wanted to create an application that both
              helped those who need it, and requires me as a designer to get out of my comfort zone and try working
              on something different.
              </p>
            <h3> Stage 2 - Ideation Phase:</h3>
              <p> After deciding to work with high schoolers that need help in school, I began the ideation phase of the project. The goal of this phase was to come up with as many ideas as possible with no regard for technical limitations or realism. Below is a small sample of the ideas I came up with for this project.</p>

            <h3> Stage 3 - Ideation Refinement &amp; Storyboards</h3>
            <p> After coming up with several ideas, it was time to solicit feedback and refine
                them into more concrete and realistic solutions. To do this, we split up into small teams
                and each critiqued each others ideas and offered suggestions for improvement. These suggestions helped narrow down my application into real-world concepts which can be seen the storyboards.

              <h3> Stage 4 - 1st Round of Interviews </h3>
              <p>
                Normally, this step would occur much earlier in the design process, but for this project user interviews came later so ideas
                and concepts were not constrained by real world users. I was able to get ahold of several current middle and high school students
                and ask them about the unique challenges they face, what their frustrations are, and how things could be improved. My findings were as follows:
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Keeping up with workloads is difficult </li>
                  <li> Students who fall behind tend to stay behind </li>
                  <li> Learning disabilities make homework and exams very difficult </li>
                  <li> Students learn best from their peers or when receiving individualized attention </li>
                </ul>

              <h3> Stage 5 - Persona Creation </h3>
              <p>
                After learning about my users needs and frustrations through interviews, I was able to take that information and create 5 persona's that helped
                me, as a UX designer, think about how real people would actually use my application. Additionally I also created one anti-persona to show that some
                users have no need for this application.
